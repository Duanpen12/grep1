A file called * text_grep.txt *.
Strange text file?
Nothing unusual! A few sentences (?) To test the grep filter.
:-)

After the empty line we have a poem without a dot (yes, yes)
We now give 4 characters {+, *, 0, ^} in curly brackets.

There is no dot again, but we have the numbers: 3, 6, 8, 9
What_else? ***

Maybe the email address: my@inbox.net.pl
What next?
{End!!!}
